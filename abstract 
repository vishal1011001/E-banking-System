ABSTRACT

This report highlights the key learnings and experience gained during the industrial training program, focused on backend development. The primary project undertaken was the E-Banking System Backend, involving the implementation of core functionalities like user authentication, account management, transaction handling, and data security.

Key areas of learning included backend programming, database design, secure coding practices, and debugging techniques. The training provided practical exposure to applying theoretical concepts, enhancing problem-solving skills, and ensuring system efficiency and scalability.

This hands-on experience has been instrumental in strengthening my technical foundation and preparing me for real-world challenges in software development.
